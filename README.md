# Evo-Enter
Simple script with input UI on server !

Evo-Enter is a simple UI script that appears when players enter the server, prompting them to press Enter to gain access.

This script uses ESX only for notifications. Modifying notifications is very simple, you just have to replace them in the client.lua file.
